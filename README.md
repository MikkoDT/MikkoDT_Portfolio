## Project Details

### 1. [Machine Vision System for Inspecting Weld Quality on Stainless Steel using HDR Cameras and Deep Learning](https://github.com/MikkoDT/Machine_Vision_System_for_Inspecting_Weld_Quality_on_Stainless_Steel)
<h3 id="about-mvp">Machine Vision Project Content:</h3>

This project presents the development and evaluation of a machine vision system with Python in Jupyter Notebook for inspecting weld quality on stainless steel using HDR cameras and deep learning. The system employed a transfer learning approach, leveraging a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and adapting it to the specific task of weld defect classification.

### 2. [Machine Learning Model Productionization for Gala Groceries](https://github.com/MikkoDT/Cognizant_AI_Experience_Program/tree/main)
#### Artificial Intelligence Virtual Experience Program of Cognizant
<h3 id="about-dsp">Data Science and Data Analysis Project Content:</h3>

In this project, I developed a Python module to productionize a machine learning model for Gala Groceries. The model, originally created in a Jupyter notebook, was transformed into a production-ready Python script that can be executed to load data, train the model, and report performance metrics. The goal was to automate the training pipeline, ensuring scalability and ease of integration into production environments.

### 3. [Collapsible Solar Power Station for Farms](https://github.com/MikkoDT/11th_collapsibleProject)
I designed the mechanical structure and mechanism using SolidWorks for a portable solar power station tailored for farms. The system integrates photovoltaic panels and a battery storage unit, enabling clean and reliable energy generation. Its collapsible design ensures ease of transportation, deployment, and storage, offering flexibility and mobility for diverse farming needs.

### 4. Mechanical Manipulator types programmed in MATLAB
<h3 id="about-mp">MATLAB Projects Content:</h3>

This section showcases my proficiency in using MATLAB and its toolboxes for simulating various robotic manipulator types. These simulations are valuable tools for understanding robot kinematics, dynamics, and control strategies.

Simulations:

1. [MATLAB Cartesian manipulator](https://github.com/MikkoDT/MATLAB_Cartesian_manipulator) - This program simulates a Cartesian robot, commonly used for tasks requiring precise positioning in a rectangular workspace.
2. [MATLAB Cylindrical manipulator](https://github.com/MikkoDT/MATLAB_Cylindrical_manipulator) - This program simulates a cylindrical robot, offering flexibility in reaching points within a cylindrical workspace.
3. [MATLAB Spherical manipulator](https://github.com/MikkoDT/MATLAB_Spherical_manipulator) - This program simulates a spherical robot, ideal for tasks requiring manipulation around a central point.
4. [MATLAB Articulated manipulator](https://github.com/MikkoDT/MATLAB_Articulated_manipulator) - This program simulates an articulated robot, offering a high degree of freedom for complex movements.
5. [MATLAB SCARA manipulator](https://github.com/MikkoDT/MATLAB_SCARA_manipulator) - This program simulates a Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA), commonly used for pick-and-place applications.
6. [6-DOF SCARA V3 Robotics Toolbox](https://github.com/MikkoDT/6-DOF-SCARA-RoboticsToolbox) - This project demonstrates the use of the Robotics Toolbox by Peter Corke for simulating a 6-DOF SCARA manipulator.

Additional Notes:

These simulations were developed for my lectures in Robotics, part of the Mechatronics Engineering curriculum I teach for 3rd-year students.  Leveraging MATLAB reinforces my strong foundation in this versatile programming language and its applications in robotics and AI (including Machine Learning and Machine Vision).

The library used in this MATLAB and python program is [Robotics Toolbox by Peter Corke](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-matlab).

You need to have Robotics Toolbox library by Peter Corke to run the program.

### 5. [3-DOF Articulated Mechanical Manipulator in ROS with ARDUINO](https://github.com/MikkoDT/Arduinobot_ROS_Project)
<h3 id="about-ros">ROS Project Content:</h3>
This project focuses on the development of a 3-DOF articulated mechanical manipulator using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Arduino. The manipulator was controlled via C++ in ROS for real-time control and simulation. Python was used to solve the kinematics and perform mathematical computations for efficient motion planning. The project aimed to combine robotics control with ROS to create an interactive, functional robot system.

## Projects
### [Machine Vision System for Inspecting Weld Quality on Stainless Steel using HDR Cameras and Deep Learning](https://github.com/MikkoDT/Machine_Vision_System_for_Inspecting_Weld_Quality_on_Stainless_Steel/blob/main/README.md)

This project presents the development and evaluation of a machine vision system with Python in Jupyter Notebook for inspecting weld quality on stainless steel using HDR cameras and deep learning. The system employed a transfer learning approach, leveraging a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and adapting it to the specific task of weld defect classification.

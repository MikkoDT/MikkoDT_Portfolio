## Projects
### [Machine Vision System for Inspecting Weld Quality on Stainless Steel using HDR Cameras and Deep Learning](https://github.com/MikkoDT/Machine_Vision_System_for_Inspecting_Weld_Quality_on_Stainless_Steel/blob/main/README.md)

This project presents the development and evaluation of a machine vision system with Python in Jupyter Notebook for inspecting weld quality on stainless steel using HDR cameras and deep learning. The system employed a transfer learning approach, leveraging a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and adapting it to the specific task of weld defect classification.

### [Machine Learning Model Productionization for Gala Groceries](https://github.com/MikkoDT/Cognizant_AI_Experience_Program/tree/main
#### Artificial Intelligence Virtual Experience Program of Cognizant)

In this project, I developed a Python module to productionize a machine learning model for Gala Groceries. The model, originally created in a Jupyter notebook, was transformed into a production-ready Python script that can be executed to load data, train the model, and report performance metrics. The goal was to automate the training pipeline, ensuring scalability and ease of integration into production environments.
